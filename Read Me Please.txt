All files created by me (Matthew Walsh) with the exception of:
	1. LoadTrainingSetNoMeanStage1.c
	2. VQ_Stage1WithNoMeanCBSize16.c
	3. LBG_GenerateCodebookForStageOneSize16.c
	4. MSE_mono.c

The above files were created by my supervisor (Liam Dowling) and I modified them (some extensively) to fit the aims of the project.

These files are the code used to implement the watermarking scheme described in Chapter 3 of the report.

The file "Code Flowcharts" should give instructions as to the order each file is supposed to be run 
but just in case it doesn't work, there's a linear step-by-step provided below.

Step-by-Step Implementation of Watermarking Schemes:

TS NO MEAN STAGE 1
LBG CB 16
VQ STAGE 1
CALC MEAN
CALC VARIANCES
CALC Polarities
GENERATE KEYS.m
Generate Error Images

TS NO MEAN STAGE 2
LBG CB STAGE 2 CB 256
Generate Fragile.m

Choice:
Embedding? 
	VQ Stage 2 With Embedding & Index Constrained
Extracting? 
	VQ Stage 2 Without Embedding & Reg. VQ & Read out Indices
	Extract SF Watermark


Adding Quantised Images back together
Calculate NC value
MSE Mono
